About the toolkit
=================

.. todo::

   Consider dividing into two parts (it is relatively long compared to the
   other sections).


This toolkit is a resource intended to make it as easy as possible to organise
a workshop aimed at raising awareness of and facilitating discussion around the
diversity of roles that contribute to research.

Why is the topic important?
---------------------------

In recent years, there has been an increased perception of the potential for
interdisciplinary and collaborative research to address complex societal and
environmental needs. It is also becoming increasingly clear that a diversity
of roles and contributions is needed to drive progress and success in research
and innovation.

Realising it is no longer the case  - if it ever was - that all researchers
need to - or indeed can - have all of the skills needed to find answers to
large and complex societal questions, the knowledge sector is now looking
towards a team-based approach bringing together more overtly diverse team
members with specific skills in funding, research design, data analysis, data
management, software development, research ethics, political relationships,
dealing with business, interdisciplinarity, communications etc.

What does this new thinking mean in practice? What skills are needed to
successfully carry out research today? How are different teams composed,
managed and rewarded? Can research morph from a sector where only ‘star
researchers’ are appreciated to one where everyone, including professional
support staff, is recognised for their skills and contributions?

This toolkit helps put together and organise a workshop that explores what a
dream research team might look like and discuss what this might mean for how
research is supported, managed and rewarded.


For whom?
---------

This toolkit is for those who want to organise a workshop aimed at facilitating
discussion and raising awareness about the diversity of roles and contributions
to research.


Goals and possible outcomes of the workshop
-------------------------------------------

The primary goal of the workshop is to start the discussion and raise awareness
by getting researchers and professional support staff together in one room
collaboratively thinking about the skills and roles needed for effectively
tackling complex research questions. Participants will leave with an increased
awareness of the many skills, experiences and roles that contribute to the
success of the research system.

For instance, during our first workshop at the 2022 Edition of the Netherlands
National Open Science Festival, many insights were shared. Ideas such as the
need for traditional support to move from 'answer as questions come in' towards
embedding expertise within the faculty/school/group, based on the idea that if
you build a relationship, you can achieve so much more than with central,
anonymous support. And that what is needed for this is a change from project
management thinking (finite, disconnected) to more integral programs and
continuous change and value based working is needed. Project goals should be
better linked to larger goals, which are often mentioned in the strategy of
universities, but are not easy to find in the actual projects. Moreover, while
discussing these kinds of new approaches, it is important to rethink how to
successfully engage with other colleagues and build effective collaborations.
For instance, values like shared ownership can help to engage larger teams;
people then feel connected to the project as a whole, even when they are
responsible for just a small task. Above all, all participants stressed the
importance of appreciating everyone’s contributions.

By discussing these points with others in the workshop, participants are likely
to start thinking differently about research teams and how these teams are
supported, managed and rewarded. At least a small proportion of the
participants may feel motivated to take this thinking further - either through
specific actions within their own sphere of influence, and/or through engaging
in broader activities aiming at enhanced cooperation, synergies, and
transdisciplinary collaboration.

The topics discussed in the workshop are also directly relevant to the ongoing
reform of research assessment and other current developments on recognition and
rewards in academia. The workshop may help research performing institutions
raise awareness and facilitate discussion on these topics.


Why this toolkit?
-----------------

The authors organised a workshop on this topic at the Dutch National Open
Science Festival 2022, which led to a lot of engagement and discussion.
Subsequently, the organisers received requests from colleagues at other
institutions to host similar workshops. Rather than organising further
workshops, we felt it would be more useful and more sustainable to provide
others with the tools and information necessary to organise their own
workshops. Therefore, we created this toolkit to support anyone who wishes to
organise similar future workshops and to make it as easy as possible for them
to do so.


Content of the toolkit
----------------------

The toolkit is composed of the following elements:

* :doc:`about`: Description of the toolkit (this chapter).
* :doc:`practicalities`: Information about specific organisational aspects related to
  this workshop.
* :doc:`agenda`: an actionable and re-usable workshop agenda, with some practical
  tips, which you might use to support your own workshop.
* :doc:`scenario`: During the workshop the participants will be presented with a
  fictional research project (a scenario)  that will underpin their discussions
  about the composition and skills that the ideal research team will need to
  have to tackle that particular project. This toolkit offers one possible
  scenario to support such a discussion, shares some insights which might help
  you develop an alternative scenario to suit your needs, and also offers some
  guidance for facilitating the discussion.
* :doc:`activity`: A step by step explanation of the workshop activity.
* :doc:`slide_deck`: Presentation template which you can use to introduce the
  workshop, the scenario and the breakout activities
* :doc:`activity_sheet`: Printout copy of an activity sheet that each breakout group
  can use to facilitate their discussion. Print them out in a large format
  (e.g. A0).


Invitation to collaborate
-------------------------
If you decide to run a similar workshop, we would love to hear from you. We
invite you to share your own experiences and materials with the community. We
all benefit from each other's resources and experiences. Through collaboration
we can keep improving these materials.

That’s why we chose to host the toolkit on GitHub to make sure that anyone can
easily build on and further develop the toolkit. You can contribute as little
or as much as you want. You can start by making a comment on the resources,
sharing your observations and experiences, improving the materials we have
already made available, adding your own materials (for example, your own
slides, new scenarios, modified agendas) or starting a discussion.
